# INVESTIGATING-POPULAR-GAME-GENRES-IN-JAPAN
The project focused on investigating popular game genres in Japan and analyzing their impacts on game firms. I worked on this project as a part of course work in Statistical Data mining class. This analysis enabled me to deliver valuable insights crucial for refining game development and marketing strategies within the dynamic Japanese gaming industry. Through this project, my goal was to showcase my expertise in statistical analysis, particularly in employing LMER modeling to derive meaningful insights from complex data sets in the context of the gaming industry.
